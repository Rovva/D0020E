# Road Condition Monitoring RCM

## Requirements

Debian/Ubuntu

### Docker

Installation varies slightly between versions, see

```
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-docker-ce
```

for installation guide.

## Installation
The installation of the web app is done by using docker. Currently all
the containers are created seperately, this should probably be changed
into a single docker-compose file, but that's how it is. For now.

### Default
```
git clone https://github.com/Rovva/D0020E
cd Road-Condition-Monitoring && ./deploy
```

## Data
Data gathered from 2018-03-05 to 2018-03-07 can be imported from ``` sql\table_plus_data.sql ```

### For all
The database import is done under `scripts/` the
`scripts/connection.js` connects to the remote SQL database. The host,
user, password, and database needs to be entered there for the import
to work.


## Error
Here are some errors that might happen.
### Database pull
If the database extration to elasticsearch fails, then run `docker
start -a rcm-pull`.

## Restart Application
```
docker restart rcm-web
```

## Rebuild Project
Use fast_restart to rebuild after changes.
```
./fast_restart
```
## Start the Java-backend
The "Java-backend" pulls data from Trafikverkets with the Datex II standard, every 10 minutes. To set a different timespan, simply edit the file start.sh, Java_D0020E/Docker/start.sh on the row where sleep is and set another value. To make the backend pull data every hour, simply edit to "sleep 1h". See this link for more information: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-sleep-bash-scripting/

Deploy the backend:
sh Java_D0020E/deploy-java

## Development
